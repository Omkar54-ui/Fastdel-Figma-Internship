INTERN ID - CT04DG2451

DOMAIN - FIGMA

DURATION - 4 WEEKS

MENTOR - NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION - 

During this internship, I took the initiative to explore and learn Figma thoroughly using available online resources. I broke down each task and tackled them step-by-step by referring to:

YouTube tutorials for interface design and prototyping

Figma Community Files to understand design systems and UI examples

Google searches to solve specific design challenges and find inspiration

For the logo design, I explored various layouts and icon styles based on industry standards and trends.

In the collaborative task, I practiced Figmaâ€™s team features like commenting and version history by creating mock projects and simulating a real design workflow.

For the e-commerce product page, I studied real product page layouts and designed a clean, user-friendly interface focusing on usability and visual appeal.

The smart home voice UI was designed by studying UX principles for smart devices and integrating voice command flow using clean dashboard elements and icons.

I carefully followed all internship instructions, stayed active with group updates, and made sure to organize and submit all deliverables professionally.
